## Description
This project consisted of using starter and creating an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they've selected. This app runs in the browser and updates HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. When creating this I enjoyed learning how to utilize for loops, if statements, and Math.random. The thing I struggled with the most was making the password that generates to follow the character number criteria.
